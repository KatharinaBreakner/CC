# Idea
An interactive webpage.
At the beginning the title of the webpage appears, then a "standard" pattern (dimensions 1080x1080px) loads in the middle of the website.
On the left side there is a control field with controls with which the user can change the pattern design.
This includes, width of lines, color of lines, color of the background.
Under the operating field is a button with which you can download the pattern as PNG in the dimensions 1080x1080.

# Optional
Zusätzliches Element, dass man zu seinem Pattern dazufügen kann, bzw. wieder entfernen kann.
Diese Elemente erweitern das Bediehnfeld.

* Kreis
* Quadrat
* Halbkreis
* Line
